# Java Loops I

**Difficulty:** easy
</br>**Points:** 10
</br>**Skill:** Java (Basic)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

## Task
Given an integer, _N_, print its first _10_ multiples. Each multiple _N x i_ (where _1<= i <= 10_) should be printed on a new line in the form: _N x i = result_.

## Input Format
A single integer, _N_.

## Constraints
_2<= N <= 20_

## Output Format
Print _10_ lines of output; each line _i_ (where _1<= i <= 10_) contains the _result_ of _N x i_ in the form:
_N x i = result_.

## Sample Input
````java
2
````

## Sample Output
````java
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
