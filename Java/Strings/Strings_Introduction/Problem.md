This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:
````java
String myString = "Hello World!"
````

The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, _A_ and _B_, perform the following operations:

1. Sum the lengths of _A_ and _B_.
2. Determine if  is lexicographically larger than _B_ (i.e.: does _B_ come before _A_ in the dictionary?).
3. Capitalize the first letter in _A_ and _B_ and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

## Input Format

The first line contains a string _A_. The second line contains another string _B_. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

## Output Format

There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of _A_ and _B_.
For the second line, write _Yes_ if _A_ is lexicographically greater than _B_ otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both _A_ and _B_ and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

## Sample Input 0
````java
hello
java
````

## Sample Output 0
````java
9
No
Hello Java
````

## Explanation 0

String _A_ is "hello" and _B_ is "java".

_A_ has a length of _5_, and _B_ has a length of _4_; the sum of their lengths is _9_.
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, _A_ is not greater than _B_ and the answer is _No_.

When you capitalize the first letter of both _A_ and _B_ and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
