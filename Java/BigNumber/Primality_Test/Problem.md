**Difficulty:** easy

</br>**Skill:** Java (Basic)

A prime number is a natural number greater than _1_ whose only positive divisors are _1_ and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are _2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13_.

Given a large integer, _n_, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

## Input Format

A single line containing an integer, _n_ (the number to be checked).

## Constraints
_n_ contains at most _100_ digits.

## Output Format

If _n_ is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.

## Sample Input
````java
13
````

## Sample Output
````java
prime
````

## Explanation

The only positive divisors of _13_ are _1_ and _13_, so we print prime.
